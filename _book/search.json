    "text": "I am looking forward to learning remote sensing on this module!\nI have doctoral and postdoctoral training in epidemiology (of maternal and newborn health). I also have a master degree in Demography. My research so far has mainly focused on understanding health system factors that influence maternal and newborn health outcomes in resource-limited countries in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.  But I am also interested in environmental factors influencing pregnancy outcomes. This includes spatial health inequalities such as the physical distances between home and health facilities or where women live which manifests in varying health outcomes, particularly pregnancy outcome.In pursuit of my interests, I have become interested to using Earth Observation data for my research as traditional health survey data do not provide sufficient information with good coverage to understand the environments where women live.\nAnyway, I am looking forward to learning how to manipulate remotely sensed data including Google Earth Engine later in the term."
